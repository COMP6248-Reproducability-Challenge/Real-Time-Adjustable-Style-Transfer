## Abstract
[Babaeizadeh and Ghiasi](https://iclr.cc/virtual_2020/poster_HJe_Z04Yvr.html) is a paper submitted to the ICLR 2020 conference, entitled ‘Adjustable Real-Time Style Transfer’,  involving  the  inclusion  of  a  secondary  network  to  facilitate  adjusting  of  tuning  hyperparameterswithout  retraining  the  original  network,  which  would  otherwise  require  many  hours  of  computation.   Thisdocument  reports  an  attempt  to  recreate  the  paper’s  findings,  using  examples  of  produced  stylised  images,reproduced figures and descriptions of the difficulties and nuances of reproducing the described network.
